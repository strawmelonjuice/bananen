## Show me

<span style="color: #ffcc00">Bananen</span> also generates changelogs for <span style="color: #ffcc00">bananen</span>! You can see those [here](./CHANGELOG)!


## Why?

To be fair, I forget what I changed per release, and find it VERY hard to  hold onto a single changelogging format. This might make it hard for users to understand what changes are made to their software. <span style="color: #ffcc00">Bananen</span> is a CLI tool on purpose, I can easily use it from the bash in my VSCode or Lapce, without even having to change files. <span style="color: #ffcc00">Bananen</span> simply keeps track of released and unreleased changes and puts them into a markdown file.

## That's a funny name, why that?

Multiple reasons actually, to name some:

- It just randomly popped up, like "oh yes, <span style="color: #ffcc00">bananen</span>!"
- I am Dutch (<span style="color: #ffcc00">bananen</span> means <span style="color: #fffc00">bananas</span>)
- <span style="color: #ffcc00">Bananen</span> is indeed funny!
- Because <span style="color: #ffcc00">bananen</span> is so funny, logging changes will give me giggles everytime, so I (an ADHD head) won't constantly forget logging changes is a thing.
