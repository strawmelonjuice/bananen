## Show me

`<span style="background-color: #24273a; color: #ffcc00">`Bananen also generates changelogs for `<span style="background-color: #24273a; color: #ffcc00">`bananen! You can see those [here](https://strawmelonjuice.com/?p=projects/bananen/changelog)!

## Why?

To be fair, I forget what I changed per release, and find it VERY hard to  hold onto a single changelogging format. This might make it hard for users to understand what changes are made to their software. `<span style="background-color: #24273a; color: #ffcc00">`Bananen is a CLI tool on purpose, I can easily use it from the bash in my VSCode or Lapce, without even having to change files. `<span style="background-color: #24273a; color: #ffcc00">`Bananen simply keeps track of released and unreleased changes and puts them into a markdown file.

## That's a funny name, why that?

Multiple reasons actually, to name some:

- It just randomly popped up, like "oh yes, `<span style="background-color: #24273a; color: #ffcc00">`bananen!"
- I am Dutch (`<span style="background-color: #24273a; color: #ffcc00">`bananen means `<span style="background-color: black; color: #fffc00">`bananas)
- `<span style="background-color: #24273a; color: #ffcc00">`Bananen is indeed funny!
- Because `<span style="background-color: #24273a; color: #ffcc00">`bananen is so funny, logging changes will give me giggles everytime, so I (an ADHD head) won't constantly forget logging changes is a thing.
